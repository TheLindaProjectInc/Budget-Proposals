# Budget Proposals

This is a temporary budget proposal repository outlining proposals for Budget allocation from the Metrixcoin DGP budgets.

The current budget amount can be viewed at https://explorer.metrixcoin.com/address/28238c7d116aa2ca3739c4c93038fd5a06a77303 under the Metrix balance value. This will increase during the course of a month until the settlement block is reached, at which point funds will be either paid out to passed budget proposals or burned if no proposal is passed. Settlement is every 28800 blocks.

Anyone can create a proposal for this budget. It costs 600000 MRX to submit a proposal.
We would first ask that you join our [discord](https://discord.gg/VagFDrj9H7) to discuss the community appetite for you proposal prior to submission, which may also aid you in getting the required number of passing votes.

Proposals can then be submitted via the Governance tab in Altitude. (Remember to include the link to the proposal you create here.)

## Burns

All chain burns can be viewed on the below address, this includes the monthly budget burn of unallocated funds. (There is a lot of pages here, so scrolling through may take some time.)
