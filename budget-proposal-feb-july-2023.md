## Budget Proposal Feb 2022 to Jul 2023

6 month Proposed Budget: Feb 2022 to Jul 2023

### Amount: 8,500,000 MRX

As there have been no budget proposals for a few months now there are a few outstanding payments to be made for social media management, with any remaining MRX allocated to the dev fund.
The split of this is expected to be around 80/20 for this first 3 months budget allocation. This doc will be updated for the final 3 months allocation splits.

- 6800000 Social media management
- 1700000 Dev Fund
